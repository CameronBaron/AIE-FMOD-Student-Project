# AIE-FMOD-Student-Project

Welcome to this FMOD Tutorial Project.

This project will teach you many of the basic, as well as a few more advanced, tools and techniques for implementing FMOD Studio 
sounds into your Unity project.
 
Everything you need to know about setting up your project with the FMOD Unity Integration can be found at 
http://www.fmod.org/documentation/#content/generated/engine_new_unity/getting_started.html.
There is a lot of documentation to hopfully help any issue that may arrise, otherwise the Q&A forums 
(http://www.fmod.org/questions/categories/unity) are a great place to find answers.


Key points to keep in mind:

***Using headphones will enhance the experience and give you a better understanding of what is happening***

- After downloading the project, open the Overworld Scene and hit play!

- Press ESC for the Main Menu, and ESC again to close it.

- Options (Graphics Settings/Volume Controls) are available in the Main Menu.

- Teleporting to each room is accessed through the ESC Menu.

- Floating FMOD logo's around the world will give you more information when activated by looking directly at them.

- All the sounds in the project are using FMOD Studio and the FMOD Unity Integration.

- We have tried to use the default FMOD scripts that come with the Integration as much as possible just to show how easy it is to use.

- In every custom script containing FMOD, you will see this comment structure before the lines that refer to FMOD:

  /*===============================Fmod=========================================
  |       So using - find "FMOD" should take you to all the important bits.    |
  ============================================================================*/

- Feel free to use any and everything from this project in your own games!
